# Complete Shell Scripting Guide

## 1. Script Writing Tips

1. Always start with `#!/bin/sh` or `#!bin/bash`
2. Use meaningful variable names
3. Add comments to explain complex logic

## 2. Variables

### Basic Variable Usage

```bash
# Creating variables (NO SPACES around =)
name="John"          # ✓ Correct
age=25              # ✓ Correct
city="New York"     # ✓ Correct

name = "John"       # ✗ Wrong: spaces will cause error
age = 25           # ✗ Wrong: spaces will cause error

# Using variables (always use $ to read variable)
echo "Hello, $name!"
echo "You are $age years old"
echo "You live in $city"
```

### Command Output in Variables

```bash
# Store command output in variable
current_date=$(date)
files_count=$(ls | wc -l)

echo "Today is: $current_date"
echo "Number of files: $files_count"
```

## 3. Special Variables

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Save as args.sh and run: ./args.sh apple banana orange

echo "Script name: $0"         # Output: ./args.sh
echo "First argument: $1"      # Output: apple
echo "Second argument: $2"     # Output: banana
echo "Number of arguments: $#" # Output: 3
echo "All arguments: $@"       # Output: apple banana orange
```

## 4. Control Structures

### If Statements

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Simple if-else example
age=18

if [ $age -ge 18 ]; then
    echo "You are an adult"
else
    echo "You are a minor"
fi

# Check if file exists
if [ -f "config.txt" ]; then
    echo "Config file found"
else
    echo "Config file missing"
fi
```

### Loops

```bash
# For loop example
for fruit in apple banana orange; do
    echo "I like $fruit"
done

# While loop example
count=1
while [ $count -le 5 ]; do
    echo "Count: $count"
    count=$((count + 1))
done

# Loop through files
for file in *.txt; do
    echo "Processing $file"
done
```

## 5. Reading User Input

```bash
# Simple input
echo "What's your name?"
read name
echo "Hello, $name!"

# Input with prompt
read -p "Enter your age: " age
echo "You are $age years old"

# Secure password input (hidden)
read -sp "Enter password: " password
echo
```

## 6. Common Operators

```bash
# Arithmetic
result=$((5 + 3))    # Addition
result=$((10 - 5))   # Subtraction
result=$((4 * 2))    # Multiplication
result=$((10 / 2))   # Division

# String comparison
if [ "$name" = "John" ]; then
    echo "Hello John!"
fi

# Numeric comparison
if [ "$age" -gt 18 ]; then
    echo "Adult"
fi
```

## 7. File Operations

```bash
# Check if file exists
if [ -f "file.txt" ]; then
    echo "File exists"
fi

# Check if directory exists
if [ -d "documents" ]; then
    echo "Directory exists"
fi

# Create backup of a file
cp "file.txt" "file.txt.backup"
```

## 8. Functions

```bash
# Define reusable code blocks
greet() {
    echo "Hello, $1!"
}
greet "John"

```

## 9. Debug Your Scripts

```bash
# Add at start of script for debugging
set -x  # Print commands as they execute
set -e  # Exit on error

# Or run script with debugging:
bash -x ./myscript.sh
```

## **10. Congratulations 🎉**

Wow 😮! You’ve made it this far!  
You now have a **solid foundation** in Linux CLI.

There’s not much left for me to teach, just keep practicing! Here are some [example scripts](https://github.com/titanknis/ISIMM-L1-Info-Cours/tree/main/Systeme%20d'exploitation/MySummary/ExampleScripts) to read.

Remember:

> **Linux isn’t hard, it is those first steps that are the hardest.**

Good luck with your exams and future! 🚀  
Happy scripting! 💻🎉
